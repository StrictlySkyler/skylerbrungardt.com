            <h3 class="title">Resignation From The College Board</h3>
            <div class="body">
              <p>XXXXX,</p>
              <p>I hereby tender this message with my resignation from The College Board, effective on Friday, May 11th, 2012.</p>
              <p>It has been a great honor for me to contribute to The College Board mission over the two years of my tenure here, and I'm honored to have worked with some very fantastic engineers; some of the best in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  I'm also very grateful for your constant and diligent shepherding of an excellent, vibrant work environment which fosters creativity and accomplishment.  This is a worthwhile goal in and of itself, in my opinion, and I'm happy to have been able to see it in action.</p>
              <p>Over the course of the next month I'll work to transition the knowledge I have to the peers on my team who will be assuming my responsibilities, and to prepare them for their new duties.  I'm also happy to contribute in any specific way you think of to make this an easy transition.</p>
              <p>I hope The College Board continues to serve and support prospective college students, administrators, teachers, and every other part of the educational system for many years to come.  I look forward to the opportunity to work with The College Board again later down the road, and should our professional paths cross again, it would be my great pleasure to work with you, specifically, also.</p>
              <p>As for the cause of my decision to resign, I leave you with a quote by George Bernard Shaw:</p>
              <blockquote>The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself.  Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man.</blockquote>

              <p>Right now, I build websites, create wireframes, and lay down some wicked HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (                <a href="http://nodejs.org" target="_blank">node.js</a>
 is my favorite toy).</p>
              <p>Fundamentally, however, I've spent the last twenty-odd years of my life working to solve a basic problem:</p>
              <p>Our computers have                 <em>failed</em>
 us.</p>
              <p>When compared with other tools, like a drill or a screwdriver, even complicated ones such as automobiles or appliances, the maintenance and upkeep of computers abuses a disproportionately large amount of our time and energy, generating an equally abusive level of frustration and displeasure for the people using them.</p>
              <p>I work to make this better.</p>
              <p>In my mind, using a computer should be as simple and intuitive as using a screwdriver or a hammer, or at the very least, as reliably consistent as driving a car.  In my opinion, neither is close to being true right now.</p>
              <p>This quest of mine has led me through the deepest, darkest parts the tech world, from Systems Administration to Enterprise Architecture, and has landed me squarely at the understanding that the only way to achieve the level of consistent, easy User Experience I want is make it ubiquitous on the Web.</p>
              <p>I have a sneaking suspicion that JavaScript will be the next C, and I'd like to make sure we get it right this time around.</p>

              <p>Right now, I build websites, create wireframes, and lay down some wicked HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (                <a href="http://nodejs.org" target="_blank">node.js</a>
 is my favorite toy).</p>
              <p>Fundamentally, however, I've spent the last twenty-odd years of my life working to solve a basic problem:</p>
